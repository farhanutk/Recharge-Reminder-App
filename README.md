# Recharge Reminder App

This app lets you keep track of your frequent mobile recharges.

## What's working now

I am just learning Flutter and the app is in its development stage.

The base app is ready. But currently, you can't save the frequent recharges permanently in the app. The data will get deleted every time you restart the app.

## TODO

- connect a database (I'm thinking of Hive, which is a fast NoSQL database) [Done âœ…]
- store *Expiry Date* instead of *Validity*
- add form validation
- add notification functionality to remind users about the recharge validity
- maybe store the data in the cloud in the future
