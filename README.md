# Recharge Reminder App

This app lets you keep track of your frequent mobile recharges.

## What's working now

The base app is ready. My objective was to learn different Flutter concepts by implementing different features in this app.

I am done with this project for now and might add additional features in the future.

## TODO

- connect a database (I'm thinking of Hive, which is a fast NoSQL database) [Done ✅]
- store *Expiry Date* instead of *Validity* [Done ✅]
- sort recharge list according to *Expiry Date* [Done ✅]
- add form validation [Done ✅]
- add notification functionality to remind users about the recharge validity [Done ✅]
- add an app icon [Done ✅]
- tidy up the code [Done ✅]

## Features I might add in the future
- a button to quickly find recharge packs for the particular mobile number
- let users edit recharge details
- let users edit the notification timing
- add support for other categories of recharges (e.g., DTH) 
- maybe store the data in the cloud
