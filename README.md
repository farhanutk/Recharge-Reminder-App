# Recharge Reminder App

This app lets you keep track of your frequent mobile recharges.

## What's working now

I am just learning Flutter and the app is in its development stage.

The base app is ready. My objective is to learn different Flutter concepts by implementing different features in this app.

## TODO

- connect a database (I'm thinking of Hive, which is a fast NoSQL database) [Done ✅]
- store *Expiry Date* instead of *Validity* [Done ✅]
- sort recharge list according to *Expiry Date* [Done ✅]
- add form validation [Done ✅]
- add notification functionality to remind users about the recharge validity [Done ✅]
- add an app icon
- tidy up the code
- maybe store the data in the cloud in the future
